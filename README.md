# Smart Campus Navigation App
## Overview
The Smart Campus Navigation App is a school project designed to help users navigate the University of Cape Coast (UCC) campus by identifying buildings through images. Users can take pictures of unique buildings, and the app will predict the building's name based on the image.

This project is still in development, with a primary focus on building and fine-tuning the machine learning model for image classification. The data and images used are specific to the UCC campus.

## Current Status
- üöß Project In Progress: The project is not complete yet. The machine learning model has been written but is currently undergoing further tuning to improve accuracy and performance.
- üåê Dataset: The dataset is specific to UCC campus buildings. However, it has not yet been uploaded to an online cloud service.

## Features
- Image Recognition: Classifies images of campus buildings.
- Data Augmentation: Enhances the training dataset with various transformations.
- Model Evaluation: Includes accuracy and loss visualization, and confusion matrix for performance analysis.
- Prediction: Allows users to upload an image and get a prediction on which building it represents.

## Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The dataset used for this project is specific to UCC campus and has not been uploaded to an online cloud yet.
- üõ†Ô∏è The model is still undergoing tuning and adjustments for better accuracy. Contributions or suggestions for improvements are welcome.
- üöß This is a school project, and as such, it is still under development with data sourced directly from images taken on the UCC campus.
